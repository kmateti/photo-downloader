# Photo Downloader

Photo-Downloader copies image and video files from a source path(typically an SD card path) to a destination path, and creates a directory tree based on the modification date of the file.  This is hardcoded to the small subset of image and video files that I work with.  The folder structure is also hardcoded to my preference. 

This was created to replace what I used to solely use Rapid Photo Downloader to do.  But, in the mos recent version, it continuously crashes in Kubuntu 18.04.1 LTS.  So, this is super simple, and it works.
